## 🔄 Device Activation User Flow

### Scenario 1: New Device During MFA Authentication
1. **User completes username/password** → MFA validation successful
2. **SDK detects unregistered device** → Triggers `addNewDeviceOptions` event  
3. **Automatic navigation to VerifyAuthScreen** → Screen loads with device options
4. **Automatic REL-ID Verify activation** → `performVerifyAuth(true)` called immediately
5. **Push notifications sent** → Registered devices receive approval requests
6. **User approves on registered device** → New device activation confirmed
7. **Continue MFA flow** → Proceed to LDA consent or completion

### Scenario 2: Fallback Activation (Device Not Available)
1. **REL-ID Verify process initiated** → But registered devices not accessible
2. **User taps "Use Alternative Method"** → Fallback option selected
3. **Fallback activation flow initiated** → `fallbackNewDeviceActivationFlow()` called
4. **Alternative verification process** → Server-configured challenge method
5. **User completes alternative verification** → Device activation confirmed
6. **Continue MFA flow** → Proceed to remaining authentication steps

### Scenario 3: Notification Management Access
1. **User completes authentication** → Reaches dashboard
2. **Opens drawer navigation** → Taps hamburger menu
3. **Selects "🔔 Get Notifications"** → Navigation to GetNotificationsScreen
4. **Notifications auto-load** → `getNotifications()` API called automatically
5. **View notification actions** → Tap "View Actions" on notification items
6. **Select and submit actions** → Modal interface with radio button selection
7. **Real-time UI updates** → `updateNotification()` API with immediate feedback

- **Push Notification Best Practices**: [Mobile Push Notification Guidelines](https://developer.uniken.com/docs/push-notifications)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Device Activation Best Practices
1. **Test with multiple physical devices** - REL-ID Verify requires real device-to-device communication
2. **Handle network timeouts gracefully** - Push notifications depend on network connectivity
3. **Provide clear status messaging** - Users need feedback during activation processes
4. **Implement comprehensive fallback flows** - Always provide alternative activation methods
5. **Test background/foreground scenarios** - Device activation can occur across app state changes


### Integration & Development
11. **Preserve existing MFA flows** - Device activation should enhance, not disrupt existing functionality
12. **Use callback preservation patterns** - Maintain multiple event handlers for flows
13. **Implement proper error boundaries** - Handle device activation errors without crashing the app
14. **Test edge cases thoroughly** - Network failures, server errors, malformed notifications
15. **Monitor performance impact** - Ensure device activation doesn't slow down MFA flows
