## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this MFA codelab, you'll be able to:

1. **Implement complete user enrollment** with secure registration flows
2. **Build password management systems** with verification patterns
3. **Handle activation code workflows** for user verification
4. **Create consent management flows** for privacy compliance
5. **Implement drawer navigation** for multi-screen MFA applications
6. **Create reusable UI components** for consistent styling and behavior
7. **Debug and troubleshoot MFA flows** effectively

## 🏗️ Prerequisites

Before starting this codelab, ensure you've completed:

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation & Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the codelab folder
cd relid-initialize

# Place the react-native-rdna-client plugin 
# at root folder of this project (refer to Project Structure above for more info)

# Install dependencies
npm install

# iOS additional setup
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Run the application
npx react-native run-android
# or
npx react-native run-ios
```

## 📚 Advanced Resources

- **REL-ID MFA Documentation**: [Multi-Factor Authentication Guide](https://developer.uniken.com/docs/mfa)
- **React Navigation Drawer**: [Drawer Navigation Patterns](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/drawer-navigator/)

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test complete user flows** - Verify the entire enrollment to verification process
2. **Implement progressive disclosure** - Don't overwhelm users with too many steps at once
3. **Handle network failures gracefully** - MFA flows often depend on server communication
4. **Provide clear feedback** - Users need to understand each step of the MFA process
5. **Test on real devices** - Touch ID, Face ID, and biometric features require physical devices
6. **Consider accessibility** - Ensure MFA flows work with screen readers and assistive technologies
